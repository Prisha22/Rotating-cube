# Heat-recovery-device
Implemented overset dynamic mesh method in OpenFOAM (v2312). Cube is rotated with angular velocity 5 rad/sec.
	-> Cube is of unit dimensions.
	-> k-epsilon turbulence model has been used. 
	-> solver used: overPimpleDyMFoam .
	-> Cube has been modeled using Fusion 360 (educational license).
	-> Meshed using snappyHexMesh.
